I did use SB-Admin-2 but it's not updated so I was thinking of redoing it and using help from SB-Admin Bootstrap 4 theme to help with that a little. I don't have all pages done but I did do what I could. In no way am I the sole creator of this project I am just helping getting this template updated and back online.
